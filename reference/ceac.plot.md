# Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curve (CEAC) Plot

Produces a plot of the Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curve (CEAC)
against the willingness to pay threshold.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'bcea'
ceac.plot(
  he,
  comparison = NULL,
  pos = "bottomright",
  graph = options("bcea.graph"),
  ...
)

ceac.plot(he, ...)
```

## Arguments

- he:

  A `bcea` object containing the results of the Bayesian modelling and
  the economic evaluation.

- comparison:

  Selects the comparator, in case of more than two interventions being
  analysed. Default as NULL plots all the comparisons together. Any
  subset of the possible comparisons can be selected (e.g.,
  `comparison=c(1,3)` or `comparison=2`).

- pos:

  Parameter to set the position of the legend (only relevant for
  multiple interventions, ie more than 2 interventions being compared).
  Can be given in form of a string `(bottom|top)(right|left)` for base
  graphics and `bottom|top|left|right` for ggplot2. It can be a
  two-elements vector, which specifies the relative position on the x
  and y axis respectively, or alternatively it can be in form of a
  logical variable, with `FALSE` indicating to use the default position
  and `TRUE` to place it on the bottom of the plot.

- graph:

  A string used to select the graphical engine to use for plotting.
  Should (partial-) match the three options `"base"`, `"ggplot2"` or
  `"plotly"`. Default value is `"base"`. This is set globally upon
  loading `BCEA` and can be modified for instance by using
  `options("bcea.graph"="gg")`, or `options("bcea.graph="plotly")`.
  Partial matching still applies (so `gg` or `pl` also work). Not all
  plotting functions have a `"plotly"` implementation, yet – see help
  for the specifics.

- ...:

  If `graph = "ggplot2"` and a named theme object is supplied, it will
  be passed to the ggplot2 object. The usual ggplot2 syntax is used.
  Additional arguments:

  - `line = list(color)`: specifies the line colour(s) - all graph
    types.

  - `line = list(type)`: specifies the line type(s) as `lty` numeric
    values - all graph types.

  - `line = list(size)`: specifies the line width(s) as numeric values -
    all graph types.

  - `currency`: Currency prefix to willingness to pay values - ggplot2
    only.

  - `area_include`: logical, include area under the CEAC curves - plotly
    only.

  - `area_color`: specifies the AUC colour - plotly only.

## Value

- ceac:

  If `graph = "ggplot2"` a ggplot object, or if `graph = "plotly"` a
  plotly object containing the requested plot. Nothing is returned when
  `graph = "base"`, the default.

The function produces a plot of the cost-effectiveness acceptability
curve against the discrete grid of possible values for the willingness
to pay parameter. Values of the CEAC closer to 1 indicate that
uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness of the reference intervention is
very low. Similarly, values of the CEAC closer to 0 indicate that
uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness of the comparator is very low.

## Details

The CEAC estimates the probability of cost-effectiveness, with respect
to a given willingness to pay threshold. The CEAC is used mainly to
evaluate the uncertainty associated with the decision-making process,
since it enables the quantification of the preference of the compared
interventions, defined in terms of difference in utilities. Formally,
the CEAC is defined as:

\$\$\textrm{CEAC} = P(\textrm{IB}(\theta) \> 0)\$\$

If the net benefit function is used as utility function, the definition
can be re-written as

\$\$\textrm{CEAC} = P(k \cdot \Delta_e - \Delta_c \> 0)\$\$

effectively depending on the willingness to pay value \\k\\.

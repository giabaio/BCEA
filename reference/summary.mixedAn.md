# Summary Methods For Objects in the Class `mixedAn` (Mixed Analysis)

Prints a summary table for the results of the mixed analysis for the
economic evaluation of a given model.

## Usage

``` r
# S3 method for class 'mixedAn'
summary(object, wtp = 25000, ...)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  An object of the class `mixedAn`, which is the results of the function
  [`mixedAn()`](https://n8thangreen.github.io/BCEA/reference/mixedAn-set.md),
  generating the economic evaluation of a set of interventions,
  considering given market shares for each option.

- wtp:

  The value of the willingness to pay chosen to present the analysis.

- ...:

  Additional arguments affecting the summary produced.

## Value

Produces a table with summary information on the loss in expected value
of information generated by the inclusion of non cost-effective
interventions in the market.

> Perform Bayesian Cost-Effectiveness Analysis in R.

:rocket: This is the **development version** of the `R` package `BCEA` (currently on version `r packageDescription("BCEA")$Version`). The stable version is now release `r utils::available.packages(filters = "CRAN")["BCEA",2]`, on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BCEA/index.html).

## Overview

Given the results of a Bayesian model (possibly based on MCMC) in the form of simulations from the posterior distributions of suitable variables of costs and clinical benefits for two or more interventions, produces a health economic evaluation. Compares one of the interventions (the "reference") to the others ("comparators").

## Features
Main features of `BCEA` include:

* Cost-effectiveness analysis plots, such as CE planes and CEAC
* Summary statistics and tables
* EVPPI calculations and plots

## Installation
Install the [released version from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BCEA) with

```r
install.packages("BCEA")
```

The development version (in this repo, which can be updated more quickly and more often than the stable one) can be installed from `r-universe.dev`, using the following command

```r
install.packages(
  'BCEA', 
  repos = c('https://giabaio.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org')
)
```

Alternatively, you can intall the development version using `remotes`, with the following command.

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("giabaio/BCEA")
```

**NB**: On Windows machines, you need to install a few dependencies, including [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) first, e.g. by running

```r
pkgs <- c("MASS", "Rtools", "remotes")
repos <- "https://cran.rstudio.com"
install.packages(pkgs, repos = repos, dependencies = "Depends")
```

before installing the package using `remotes`.

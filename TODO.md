# TO-DO list

## July 2025

* Check whether we can remove all the dependencies/instances of use of `reshape2`; it seems like this is a deprecated package and could be easily replaced with `tidyr` for reshaping datasets.

* Check the code all-round to see where we can find bottlenecks in computation and make things quicker.

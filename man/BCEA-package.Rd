\title{BCEA: A package for Bayesian Cost-Effectiveness Analysis}
\description{
A package to post-process the results of a Bayesian health economic model
and produce standardised output for the analysis of the results.

BCEA produces a health economic evaluation given a random sample of
suitable variables of costs and clinical benefits for two or more
interventions, e.g. using results of a Bayesian model (possibly based on
MCMC) in the form of simulations from the posterior distributions.
Compares one of the interventions (the "reference") to the others
("comparators"). Produces many summaries and plots to analyse the results.

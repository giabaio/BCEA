\title{Smoking Cessation Cost-Effectiveness Data}
\format{
A list containing the variables for the cost-effectiveness analysis:
\describe{
\item{cost}{A matrix of 500 simulations from the posterior distribution
of the overall costs for the four strategies.}
\item{data}{A dataset with characteristics of smokers in the UK population.}
\item{eff}{A matrix of 500 simulations from the posterior distribution of
the clinical benefits for the four strategies.}
\item{life.years}{A matrix of 500 simulations from the posterior
distribution of the life years gained with each strategy.}
\item{pi_post}{A matrix of 500 simulations from the posterior
distribution of the probability of smoking cessation with each strategy.}
\item{smoking}{A data frame with inputs for the network meta-analysis,
containing: \code{nobs} (record ID), \code{s} (study ID), \code{i}
(intervention ID), \code{r_i} (number of patients who quit),
\code{n_i} (total patients in arm), and \code{b_i} (reference
intervention for the study).}
\item{smoking_output}{A matrix of results from the network meta-analysis model
run on the \code{smoking} object.}
\item{treats}{A character vector of labels for the four strategies.}

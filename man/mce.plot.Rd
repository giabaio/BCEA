\title{Plots the probability that each intervention is the most cost-effective}
\usage{
mce.plot(mce, pos = c(1, 0.5), graph = c("base", "ggplot2"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mce}{The output of the call to the function \code{\link[=multi.ce]{multi.ce()}}.}

\item{pos}{Parameter to set the position of the legend. Can be given in form
of a string \code{(bottom|top)(right|left)} for base graphics and
\code{bottom|top|left|right} for ggplot2. It can be a two-elements vector,
which specifies the relative position on the x and y axis respectively, or
alternatively it can be in form of a logical variable, with \code{TRUE}
indicating to use the first standard and \code{FALSE} to use the second one.
Default value is \code{c(1,0.5)}, that is on the right inside the plot area.}

\item{graph}{A string used to select the graphical engine to use for
plotting. Should (partial-)match the two options \code{"base"} or
\code{"ggplot2"}. Default value is \code{"base"}.}

\item{...}{Optional arguments. For example, it is possible to specify the
colours to be used in the plot. This is done in a vector
\code{color=c(...)}. The length of the vector colors needs to be the same as
the number of comparators included in the analysis, otherwise \code{BCEA}
will fall back to the default values (all black, or shades of grey)}
}
\value{
\item{mceplot}{ A ggplot object containing the plot. Returned only
if \code{graph="ggplot2"}. }
}
\description{
This function is deprecated. Use \code{\link[=ceac.plot]{ceac.plot()}} instead.
Plots the probability that each of the n_int interventions being analysed is
the most cost-effective.

\itemize{
\item For single-parameter:

The user \emph{needs} to also specify the number of "blocks" (e.g. \code{n.blocks=20}).
Note that the multi-parameter version for this method has been deprecated.

\description{
Calculates the Expected Value of Perfect Partial Information (EVPPI) for
subsets of parameters. Uses GAM non-parametric regression for single
parameter EVPPI and the SPDE-INLA method for larger parameter subsets.
}
\details{
The single parameter EVPPI has been calculated using the non-parametric GAM
regression developed by Strong \emph{et al.} (2014). The multi-parameter EVPPI is
calculated using the SPDE-INLA regression method for Gaussian Process
regression developed by Heath \emph{et al.} (2015).

This function has been completely changed and restructured to make it possible
to change regression method.
The method argument can now be given as a list. The first element element in the
list is a vector giving the regression method for the effects. The second gives
the regression method for the costs. The \verb{method' argument can also be given as before which then uses the same regression method for all curves. All other }extra_args\verb{can be given as before.}int.ord\verb{can be updated using the list formulation above to give the interactions for each different curve. The formula argument for GAM can only be given once, either}te()\code{or}s() + s()`
as this is for computational reasons rather than to aid fit.
You can still plot the INLA mesh elements but not output the meshes.
}
\section{GAM regression}{

For multi-parameter, the user can select 3 possible methods. If
\code{method = "GAM"} (BCEA will accept also \code{"gam"}, \code{"G"} or
\code{"g"}), then the computations are based on GAM regression. The user can
also specify the formula for the regression. The default option is to use a
tensor product (e.g. if there are two main parameters, \code{p1} and
\code{p2}, this amounts to setting \code{formula = "te(p1,p2)"}, which
indicates that the two parameters interact). Alternatively, it is possible
to specify a model in which the parameters are independent using the
notation \code{formula = "s(p1) + s(p2)"}. This may lead to worse accuracy in
the estimates.
}

\section{Strong \emph{et al.} GP regression}{

This is used if \code{method="GP"} (BCEA will also accept the specification
\code{method="gp"}). In this case, the user can also specify the number of
PSA runs that should be used to estimate the hyperparameters of the model
(e.g. \code{n.sim=100}). This value is set by default to 500.
}

\section{INLA-related options}{

These are all rather technical and are described in detail in Baio \emph{et al.} (2017).
The optional parameter vector \code{int.ord} can take integer values (c(1,1) is
default) and will force the predictor to include interactions: if
\code{int.ord = c(k, h)}, then all k-way interactions will be used for the
effects and all h-way interactions will be used for the costs. Also, the
user can specify the feature of the mesh for the "spatial" part of the
model. The optional parameter \code{cutoff} (default 0.3) controls the
density of the points inside the mesh. Acceptable values are typically in
the interval (0.1, 0.5), with lower values implying more points (and thus
better approximation and greater computational time). The construction of the
boundaries for the mesh can be controlled by the optional inputs
\code{convex.inner} (default = -0.4) and \code{convex.outer} (default =
-0.7). These should be negative values and can be decreased (say to -0.7 and
-1, respectively) to increase the distance between the points and the outer
boundary, which also increases precision and computational time. The
optional argument\code{robust} can be set to TRUE, in which case INLA will
use a t prior distribution for the coefficients of the linear predictor.
Finally, the user can control the accuracy of the INLA grid-search for the
estimation of the hyperparameters. This is done by setting a value
\code{h.value} (default = 0.00005). Lower values imply a more refined search
(and hence better accuracy), at the expense of computational speed. The
method argument can also be given as a list allowing different regression
methods for the effects and costs, and the different incremental decisions.
The first list element should contain a vector of methods for the
incremental effects and the second for the costs, for example
\code{method = list(c("GAM"), c("INLA"))}. The \code{int.ord} argument can also
be given as a list to give different interaction levels for each regression
curve.

By default, when no method is specified by the user, \code{evppi} will
use GAM if the number of parameters is <5 and INLA otherwise.

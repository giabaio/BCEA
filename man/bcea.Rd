\arguments{
\item{eff}{An object containing \code{nsim} simulations for the variable of
clinical effectiveness for each intervention being considered. In general it
is a matrix with \code{nsim} rows and \code{nint} columns.
This are partially matched with \verb{e' from previous version of }BCEA` for back-compatibility.}

\item{cost}{An object containing \code{nsim} simulations for the variable of
cost for each intervention being considered. In general it is a matrix with
\code{nsim} rows and \code{nint} columns.
This are partially matched with \verb{c' from previous version of }BCEA` for back-compatibility.}

\item{ref}{Defines which intervention (columns of \code{eff} or \code{cost}) is
considered to be the reference strategy. The default value \code{ref = 1}
means that the intervention associated with the first column of \code{eff} or
\code{cost} is the reference and the one(s) associated with the other column(s)
is(are) the comparators.}

\item{interventions}{Defines the labels to be associated with each
intervention. By default and if \code{NULL}, assigns labels in the form
"Intervention1", ... , "InterventionT".}

\item{.comparison}{Selects the comparator, in case of more than two
interventions being analysed. Default as NULL plots all the comparisons
together. Any subset of the possible comparisons can be selected (e.g.,
\code{comparison=c(1,3)} or \code{comparison = 2}).}

\item{Kmax}{Maximum value of the willingness to pay to be considered.
Default value is \code{k = 50000}. The willingness to pay is then approximated
on a discrete grid in the interval \verb{[0, Kmax]}. The grid is equal to
\code{k} if the parameter is given, or composed of \code{501} elements if
\code{k = NULL} (the default).}

\item{k}{A(n optional) vector for the values of the willingness
to pay grid. Should be of length > 1 otherwise plots will be empty.
If not specified then BCEA will construct a grid of 501 values
from 0 to \code{Kmax}. This option is useful when performing intensive
computations (e.g. for the EVPPI). This was changed from \code{wtp} in previous versions
for consistency with other functions and so will be deprecated in the future.}

\item{plot}{A logical value indicating whether the function should produce
the summary plot or not.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments}
}

\item{delta.e}{For each possible comparison, the differential in the

\item{k}{The vector of values for the grid approximation of the willingness

is the most cost-effective for each value of the willingness to pay in the
selected grid approximation}

simulation from the Bayesian model, for each value of the grid approximation
of the willingness to pay and for each intervention being considered}

from the Bayesian model and for each value of the grid approximation of the

the Bayesian model and for each value of the grid approximation of the
willingness to pay}
\item{evi}{The vector of values for the Expected Value of Information, as
a function of the willingness to pay}
\item{interventions}{A vector of labels for all the interventions considered}

\description{
Cost-effectiveness analysis based on the results of a simulation model for a
variable of clinical benefits (e) and of costs (c). Produces results to be
post-processed to give the health economic analysis. The output is stored in
an object of the class "bcea".

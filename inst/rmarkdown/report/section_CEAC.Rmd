## Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve

The _Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curve_ (CEAC) estimates the probability of cost-effectiveness, for different willingness to pay thresholds. The CEAC is used to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the decision-making process, since it quantifies the degree to which a treatment is preferred. This is measured in terms of the difference in utilities, normally the incremental benefit. Effectively, the CEAC represents the proportion of simulations in which $t=1$ is associated with a higher utility than $t=0$.

The following graph shows the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). The CEAC represents the proportion of 'potential futures' in which the reference intervention is estimated to be more cost-effective than the comparator. Thus, it can be interpreted as the 'probability of cost-effectiveness'.

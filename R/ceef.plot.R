#' @rdname ceef.plot
#' 
#' @template args-he
#' @param comparators Vector specifying the comparators to be included in the
#' frontier analysis. It must have a length > 1. Default as `NULL` includes
#' all the available comparators.
#' @template args-pos
#' @param start.from.origins Logical. Should the frontier start from the
#'  origins of the axes? The argument is reset to `FALSE` if the average
#'  effectiveness and/or costs of at least one comparator are negative.
#' @param threshold Specifies if the efficiency should be defined based on a
#'  willingness-to-pay threshold value. If set to `NULL` (the default), no
#'  conditions are included on the slope increase. If a positive value is passed
#'  as argument, to be efficient an intervention also requires to have an ICER
#'  for the comparison versus the last efficient strategy not greater than the
#'  specified threshold value. A negative value will be ignored with a warning.
#' @param flip Logical. Should the axes of the plane be inverted?
#' @param dominance Logical. Should the dominance regions be included in the
#'  plot?
#' @param relative Logical. Should the plot display the absolute measures (the
#'  default as `FALSE`) or the differential outcomes versus the reference
#'  comparator?
#' @param print.summary Logical. Should the efficiency frontier summary be
#'  printed along with the graph?  See Details for additional information.
#' @param graph A string used to select the graphical engine to use for
#'  plotting. Should (partial-)match the two options `"base"` or
#'  `"ggplot2"`. Default value is `"base"`.
#' @param print.plot Logical. Should the efficiency frontier be plotted?
#' @param ... If `graph_type="ggplot2"` and a named theme object is supplied,
#'  it will be added to the ggplot object. Ignored if `graph_type="base"`.
#'  Setting the optional argument `include.ICER` to `TRUE` will print
#'  the ICERs in the summary tables, if produced.
#' 
#' @return \item{ceplane}{ A ggplot object containing the plot. Returned only
#' if `graph_type="ggplot2"`. } The function produces a plot of the
#' cost-effectiveness efficiency frontier. The dots show the simulated values
#' for the intervention-specific distributions of the effectiveness and costs.
#' The circles indicate the average of each bivariate distribution, with the
#' numbers referring to each included intervention. The numbers inside the
#' circles are black if the intervention is included in the frontier and grey
#' otherwise. If the option `dominance` is set to `TRUE`, the
#' dominance regions are plotted, indicating the areas of dominance.
#' Interventions in the areas between the dominance region and the frontier are
#' in a situation of extended dominance.

#' Cost-Effectiveness Efficiency Frontier (CEEF) Plot
#' 
#' The line connecting successive points on a cost-effectiveness plane which each
#' represent the effect and cost associated with different treatment alternatives.
#' The gradient of a line segment represents the ICER of the treatment comparison
#' between the two alternatives represented by that segment.
#' The cost-effectiveness frontier consists of the set of points corresponding to
#' treatment alternatives that are considered to be cost-effective at different values
#' of the cost-effectiveness threshold. The steeper the gradient between successive
#' points on the frontier, the higher is the ICER between these treatment alternatives
#' and the more expensive alternative would be considered cost-effective only when a
#' high value of the cost-effectiveness threshold is assumed.
#' Points not lying on the cost-effectiveness frontier represent treatment alternatives
#' that are not considered cost-effective at any value of the cost-effectiveness threshold.
#' 
#' Back compatibility with BCEA previous versions:
#' The `bcea` objects did not include the generating `e` and `c`
#' matrices in BCEA versions <2.1-0. This function is not compatible with
#' objects created with previous versions. The matrices can be appended to
#' `bcea` objects obtained using previous versions, making sure that the
#' class of the object remains unaltered.
#' 
#' The argument `print.summary` allows for printing a brief summary of the
#' efficiency frontier, with default to `TRUE`. Two tables are plotted,
#' one for the interventions included in the frontier and one for the dominated
#' interventions. The average costs and clinical benefits are included for each
#' intervention. The frontier table includes the slope for the increase in the
#' frontier and the non-frontier table displays the dominance type of each
#' dominated intervention. Please note that the slopes are defined as the
#' increment in the costs for a unit increment in the benefits even if
#' `flip = TRUE` for consistency with the ICER definition. The angle of
#' increase is in radians and depends on the definition of the axes, i.e. on
#' the value given to the `flip` argument.
#' 
#' If the argument `relative` is set to `TRUE`, the graph will not
#' display the absolute measures of costs and benefits. Instead the axes will
#' represent differential costs and benefits compared to the reference
#' intervention (indexed by `ref` in the [bcea()] function).

> Perform Bayesian Cost-Effectiveness Analysis in R.

This is the development version of the `R` package `BCEA`.

:rocket: **Version 2.4-6 available now!** [Check out the release notes here](https://github.com/n8thangreen/BCEA/releases) (changes are incremental with respect to the previous "stable" version, `2.4-5`. Version `2.4-6` is now the official release also available from [`CRAN`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BCEA/index.html)). This repo will contain continuous changes and improvements before the next official release on CRAN.

## Overview

Given the results of a Bayesian model (possibly based on MCMC) in the form of simulations from the posterior distributions of suitable variables of costs and clinical benefits for two or more interventions, produces a health economic evaluation. Compares one of the interventions (the "reference") to the others ("comparators").

## Features
Main features of `BCEA` include:

* Cost-effectiveness analysis plots, such as CE planes and CEAC
* Summary statistics and tables
* EVPPI calculations and plots

## Installation
Install the [released version from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BCEA) with
```r
install.packages("BCEA")
```

The stable version (which can be updated more quickly) can be installed using this GitHub repository. On Windows machines, you need to install a few dependencies, including [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) first, e.g. by running

```r
pkgs <- c("MASS", "Rtools", "remotes")
repos <- c("https://cran.rstudio.com", "https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable/") 
install.packages(pkgs, repos=repos, dependencies = "Depends")
```
before installing the package using `remotes`:

```r
remotes::install_github("giabaio/BCEA")
```
Under Linux or MacOS, it is sufficient to install the package via `remotes`:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("giabaio/BCEA")
```

#' @param comparison Selects the comparator, in case of more than two
#'                   interventions being analysed. Default as NULL plots all the comparisons
#'                   together. Any subset of the possible comparisons can be selected (e.g.,
#'                   `comparison=c(1,3)` or `comparison=2`).
